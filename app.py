I am applying for a job and want to optimize my resume for better alignment with the job description. Follow these structured steps carefully to analyze, compare, and refine my resume, keeping it natural, human-like, and ATS-friendly. Your output should be clean, concise, and strictly in markdown table format for all relevant sections.

---

### 1. Extract Responsibilities & Qualifications  
- Identify **all core responsibilities and qualifications** from the job description.  
- Distinguish between **Required** and **Preferred** or "Nice to Have" qualifications.  
- Present both categories in **separate markdown tables** with two columns:  
  - Column 1: Category (Responsibility or Qualification)  
  - Column 2: Extracted Text

---

### 2. Mismatch Analysis (Tabular Format)  
- Compare my resume line-by-line with the **job qualifications** (from Required and Preferred).  
- Use **my work experience section and skills section** to find matches.  
- Use this scoring rule:  
  - 80‚Äì100% = Clearly mentioned or strongly implied  
  - 50‚Äì79% = Partially related or indirectly referenced  
  - <50% = Missing or unclear  

- Present the output in a **markdown table** with these columns:  
  - Column 1: Job Qualification  
  - Column 2: Resume Match % Estimate  
  - Column 3: Match (üü¢ Yes / üü° Partial / üî¥ No)

‚úÖ Use **markdown table syntax only**. Do not include any extra text before or after the table.

üéØ At the end of this section, give an **Approximate ATS Match Score** (0‚Äì100%) based on overall alignment with the job.

---

### 3. Experience Refinement (Bullet Point Adjustments)  
- Only use my **work experience section** for this task.  
- For each company, review all bullets. Modify bullets to better reflect the job description without overexaggerating.  
- If multiple bullets in the same job need changes, include all of them.  
- Preserve authenticity while improving ATS friendliness.  

üßæ Present your suggestions in a **markdown table** with these columns:  
  - Column 1: Company Name  
  - Column 2: Original Bullet  
  - Column 3: Modified Bullet  
  - Column 4: Reason for Change

‚úÖ Do not use bullet points or explanations outside the table.

---

### 4. Change Log for Bullet Points  
- Track **only those bullets that were actually modified** in the Experience Refinement section.  
- Skip any bullets that remained unchanged.  
- Present them clearly and concisely.

‚úÖ Format this as a **markdown table** with 3 columns:  
  - Company Name  
  - What Was Changed  
  - Why


---

### 5. Skills Section Enhancement  
- Analyze my current skills section.  
- Suggest additions, adjustments, or removals based on the job description.  
- Focus on tools, platforms, certifications, and relevant buzzwords.  
- Prioritize industry keywords and CRM/digital/data stack tools if applicable.
- Include tools/platforms like "Microsoft Dynamics, Power Platform, Salesforce" explicitly if mentioned in the JD.
- If a preferred/bonus skill is not harmful, **retain it** rather than remove it.

‚úÖ Present this in a **markdown table** with 3 columns:  
  - Existing Skill  
  - Suggested Action (Keep, Remove, Replace, Add)  
  - Reason / JD Relevance

---

üìå Important Guidelines:  
‚Ä¢ Use markdown tables only for structured data.  
‚Ä¢ Maintain a human, natural tone in refinements.  
‚Ä¢ Keep suggestions ATS-friendly and realistic.  
‚Ä¢ DO NOT include introductory text before tables.  
‚Ä¢ Make output clean and professional-looking.
