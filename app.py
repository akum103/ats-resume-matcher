I am applying for a job and want to optimize my resume for better alignment with the job description. Follow these structured steps to analyze, compare, and refine my resume while keeping it natural and ATS-friendly.

1. Extract all Responsibilities & Qualifications:
o Identify and highlight all responsibilities and qualifications from the provided job description.
o Summarize them concisely in a structured manner.

2. Mismatch Analysis (Tabular Format):
o Compare my resume against the job qualifications line by line for required and preferred qualifications.
o Present the results in a table format with these columns:
  ÔÇß Column 1: Job Qualification (from JD)
  ÔÇß Column 2: My Resume‚Äôs Matching Experience with percentage
  ÔÇß Column 3: Match or No Match (Yes/No)
‚úÖ Use markdown syntax to format the mismatch table. Do not use bullet points or paragraph explanations.

Dont forget to give approximate ATS Score

3. Experience Refinement (Bullet Point Adjustments):
for this, only use my work experience.
o Modify my previous experience to better match the job description.
o Ensure the changes sound natural and human-like, avoiding exaggeration while enhancing relevance.
o Present each bullet point modification in a structured format:
  ÔÇß Column 1: Company Name
  ÔÇß Column 2: Original Bullet
  ÔÇß Column 3: Modified Bullet
  ÔÇß Column 4: Reason for Change

‚úÖ Use markdown syntax to format the mismatch table. Do not use bullet points or paragraph explanations.

4. Change Log for Bullet Points:
o Track all modifications made in the experience section.
o Do not change too much‚Äîjust enough to pass ATS filters while keeping my resume realistic and authentic.

5. Skills Section Enhancement:
o Suggest changes to my skills section by adding, rewording, or adjusting skills to align with the job description.
o Give as many skills as possible
o Prioritize industry-relevant keywords while ensuring my expertise remains credible.

üìå Important Notes:
‚Ä¢ Keep changes minimal yet impactful to pass ATS without making my resume feel unnatural.
‚Ä¢ Focus on keyword optimization rather than drastic modifications.
‚Ä¢ Maintain a human tone in all modifications.

Now, provide the analysis and refinement based on the attached job description and resume.
